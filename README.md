# Odin Project: Landing Page

This is my project to [build a landing page as part of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

Here is an example of basically what the website should look like when I am done with it and the fonts/colors I am going to be using:

![A pretty normal landing page that you would find on a modern website. It uses filler content in place of actual content and is meant to serve as a visual template.](images/example.png)

![A styleguide for the website depicted above, using cool blues, grays, and whites and the sans serif font Roboto.](images/specs.png)

At the moment, it is unclear to me what the content of the page will be that I am going to create but I am going to think of something funny and change this paragraph of the `README.md` when I do.
